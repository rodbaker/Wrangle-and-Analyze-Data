    "## WeRateDogs Twitter Data Wrangling Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The data wrangling process for the project can be broken into three steps.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Namely gathering, assessing and cleaning.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Gathering\n",
    "Data for this project came from three different sources:\n",
    "- Original twitter archive data in csv format downloaded manually\n",
    "- Additional data gathered from the WeRateDogs twitter site using Twitters API and Python Tweepy library\n",
    "- The tweets image prediction tsv file hosted on Udacity's servers was downloaded programmatically using the Requests library\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Assessing\n",
    "A number of criteria were set for assessing the data. These included:\n",
    "- only want original ratings (no retweets)\n",
    "- only want tweets that have images\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "On top of this at least 8 quality and 2 tidiness issues had to be detected visually and programmatically and then documented\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Cleaning\n",
    "- **Issue 1.** df_tweet_archive contains tweets without images. Used pandas dropna\n",
    "- **Issue 2.** Timestamp column was in wrong format. Dealt with this by using parse_dates feature in pandas.read_csv.\n",
    "- **Issue 3.** Duplicated data indicated by retweeted_status_id 181 non null values. Used pandas isnull on retweeted_status_id column and filtered.\n",
    "- **Issue 4.** Not all dogs had a name. Used regex pattern and replace.\n",
    "- **Issue 5.** Text column in df_archive_copy contains text and hyper link at the end. Used a lambda function to split on 'https' and then slice.\n",
    "- **Issue 6.** Multiple denominator values greater than or less than ten. Replaced these with 10 using boolean logic and numpy where function.\n",
    "- **Issue 7.** several records contained more than one dog stage. ie pupper and doggo for the one dog. Replaced these with np.nan\n",
    "- **Issue 8.** Dropped unwanted columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tidyness Issues included:**\n",
    "- Created function to combine four dog stage columns into one called stage\n",
    "- Merged df_archive and df_tweet_copy into one dataframe\n",
    "- Converted df_images from wide format to long using pandas wide_to_long\n",
